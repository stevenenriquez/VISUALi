# VISUALi README

**Domain**: www.visualiproductions.com

This is a responsive website I am creating for a videographer. This website is a single page. The top section has the title (the domain name)
and links to the portfolio section & contact section. There is also a fixed menu at the top left corner of the site. The fixed menu, once 
clicked, extends a menu spanning the entire screen. The menu has links to the top of the site, the portfolio section, and 
the contact section. The Portfolio section has 6 thumbnails linking to youtube videos. The Contact section has contact info and info about
the videographer.

### Built With

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript - Used to make the fixed menu and side navigation.
* JQuery - Used to make a smooth scroll to different sections of the site (Top, Portfolio, Contact), 
           animating the main header "VISUALi Productions" at the initial load of the site,
           

### Acknowledgements

* **FancyBox** - Used for the gallery of videos.
                 You can find FancyBox here: (http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/)
                 
* **Google Fonts** - For beautiful fonts. You can find Google Fonts here: (https://fonts.google.com/)

### What is unfinished?

* The content in the contact section is still being updated.
* Two videos still need to be uploaded to youtube so they can be linked. Therefore, 1 video is repeated 3 times in the gallery.
  There will always be 6 videos in the portfolio gallery.
* Firefox Responsiveness: Some trouble with responsiveness on FireFox. I need to take out the padding-left for the <div> of videos in the portfolio section.
           The top row of videos is slightly shifted to the right. Also, the scaling of elements on a phone is off. In other major browsers, 
           I do not notice any trouble with the responsiveness of the site.
